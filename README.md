# image-compressor-python

This project was made with Python based on a [Short from Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CDvs8dZPFDI).

# How to use

Run the program with the following command:
```python3
python3 image-compresor-python.py
```

You'll see the following message:
```python3
:: ~ Enter the path and name of the image to convert > 
```

You have to enter the path and name of the image to convert.
By example: `/home/user/Desktop/image.jpg`

## Define the path name and format of the image to convert.
```python3
:: ~ Enter the name of the new image to export with its extension [.jpg, .png...] > 
```
By example: `myNewImage.jpg`

## The last step is define the route to export.
```python3
:: ~ Enter the destination where the image is going to be exported [By default it is saved in the image path] > 
```
You can enter the path where you want to export the image or you can leave it blank so it will export to the same path as the image.
